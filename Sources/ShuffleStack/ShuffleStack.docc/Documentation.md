# ``ShuffleStack``

**ShuffleStack** is a sub-module of **ShuffleIt** library - a user interface library for **SwiftUI** which delivers a collection of custom stack views with a wide range of elegant shuffling, sliding and swiping behaviours.

## Overview

**ShuffleStack** provides a customizable stack view with shuffling behaviour on its stacked child views. A stack view comes with three built-in styles - `slide`, `rotateIn` and `rotateOut` - which have an unique shuffling behaviour.
