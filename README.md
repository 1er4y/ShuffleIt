## üí° Features
- [ShuffleStack](#shufflestack)
> For now, **ShuffleIt** only provides **ShuffleStack** view. (üö® Spoiler Alert - There will be very soon various types of stack views coming.)

### ShuffleStack <a id="shufflestack"></a>
**ShuffleStack** is a stack view with shuffling behaviour on the stack of content views which will be useful as a banner. Not like normal stack view, it only renders three content views visible on the screen and switches data of content views based on the current index.

#### Usage
```swift
let colors: [Color] = [.blue, .brown, .black, .cyan, .green, .indigo, .pink, .purple, .red, .orange, .yellow]
var body: some View {
    ShuffleStack(
        colors,
        initialIndex: 0
    ) { color in
        color
            .frame(height: 200)
            .cornerRadius(16)
    }
}
```

## üéâ Motivation 
As I'm kinda like an artistic guy, I really indulge in crafting something innovative, in particular, in an iOS development. It's a huge pleasure for me to explore the API and create an elegant components and then it has attached to me as my precious hobby. That's why, I used to craft various components to test out what I can achieve so far. Recently, I got the idea of gathering my creations in one place and delivering them to the world so that it can be easily used in other projects and also used as a learning resource for other developers. With this intention, I eventually published my first UI library called **ShuffleIt** for SwiftUI.
